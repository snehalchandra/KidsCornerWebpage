         <h2>Peter Pan:</h2>
        
     <p>Once upon a time in London, the darlings went out to a dinner party leaving their three children Wendy, Jhon, and Michael at home. After Wendy had tucked her younger brothers Jhon and Michael to bed, she went to read a book. She heard a boy sobbing outside her window. He was flying. There was little fairy fluttering around him. Wendy opened the window to talk to him.</p>
<p>“Hello! Who are you? Why are you crying ”, wendy asked him.</p>
<p> “My name is Peter Pan. my shadow wouldn’t stock to me.”, He replied. She asked him to come in. Peter agreed and came inside the room. Wendy took his shadow and sewed it to his shoe tips.</p>
<p>Now his shadow followed him wherever Peter Pan went! He was delighted and asked Wendy
“Why don’t you come with me to my home. The Neverland. I lived there with my fairy Tinker Bell.” Wendy – “Oh! What a wonderful idea! Let me wake up John and Micheal too. Could you teach us how to fly?”.</p>
<p> “Yes! Of course! Get them we will all fly together.” Peter Pan replied</p>
<p>And so it was. Five little figures flew out of the window of the Darlings and headed towards Neverland. As they flew over the island, Peter pan told the children more about his homeland. “All the children who get lost come and stay with Tinker Bell and me,” Peter told them.</p>
<p>The Indians also live in Neverland. The mermaids live in the lagoon around the island. And a very mean pirate called Captain Hook keeps troubling everyone.“Crocodile bit his one arm. So the captain had to put a hook in its place. Since then he is afraid of crocodiles. And rightly so! If the crocodile ever found Captain Hook it will eat up the rest of it couldn’t eat last time.” Peter told them.</p>
<p>Soon they landed on the island. And to the surprise of Wendy, Jhon and Michael, Peter Pan let them in through a small opening in a tree. Inside the tree was a large room with children inside it. Somewhere huddled by the fire in the corner and somewhere playing amongst themselves. Their faces lit up when they saw Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, and their guests.
<p>“Hello everyone. This is Wendy, Jhon, and Michael. They will be staying with us from now on.” Peter Pan introduced them to all children. Children welcomed Wendy, Jhon, and Michael.</p>
<p>A few days passed. And they settled into a routine. Wendy would take care of all the children in the day and would go out with Peter Pan and her brothers in the evening to learn about the island. She would cook for them and stitch new clothes for them. He even made a lovely new dress for Tinker Bell.</p></p>
