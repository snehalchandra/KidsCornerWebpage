      <ul>
       <li>Add glue and food coloring to bowl. Squeeze the bottle of glue into a bowl. Add your food coloring if desired, and stir until combined. Then mix in baking soda.</li>
       <li>Mix in saline solution. Add 1.5 Tablespoons saline solution and mix until combined. If it’s too sticky, add 1/2 Tablespoon more solution at a time. The more you add, the thicker it’ll be. The less you add, the slimier it’ll be</li>
       <li>Knead the slime. Using your hands, knead the slime until it holds together. It will be wet and gooey at first, but just keep kneading until it all comes together.</li>
       <li>Store slime. Store slime in a container with lid, or in a zip top bag. The slime is best to play with on a place mat.</li>
