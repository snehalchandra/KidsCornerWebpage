        <h2> STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTION:</h2>
      <ul>
       <li>Begin by folding your A4 sheet in paper in 3 length wise. Secure with some glue.</li>
       <li>With the seam of your fold on the outside, fold your paper in half. Then fold over flap. Flip and fold over the other. You will end up with a type of “M”. The point in the middle will be your mouth. The long sides of the M, fit you fingers.</li>
       <li>Cut out all your doggy shapes. For our first paper dog hand puppet we kept things simple: some floppy dog ears, a tongue, a cute Dog Nose, eyes and a dog eye patch!</li>
       <li>Now glue them all in place. With the eyes you can experiment – bring them closer together or further apart.</li>
        </ul>
