     <p>The most important thing we've learned,</p>
     <p>So far as children are concerned,</p>
<p>Is never, NEVER, NEVER let</p>
<p>Them near your television set --</p>
<p>Or better still, just don't install</p>
<p>The idiotic thing at all.</p>
<p>In almost every house we've been,</p>
<p>We've watched them gaping at the screen.</p>
<p>They loll and slop and lounge about,</p>
<p>And stare until their eyes pop out.</p>
<p>(Last week in someone's place we saw</p>
<p>A dozen eyeballs on the floor.)</p>
<p>They sit and stare and stare and sit</p>
<p>Until they're hypnotised by it,</p>
<p>Until they're absolutely drunk</p>
<p>With all that shocking ghastly junk.</p>
