     <p>I wandered lonely as a cloud</p>
<p>That floats on high o'er vales and hills,</p>
<p>When all at once I saw a crowd,</p>
<p>A host, of golden daffodils;</p>
<p>Beside the lake, beneath the trees,</p>
<p>Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</p>

<p>Continuous as the stars that shine</p>
<p>And twinkle on the milky way,</p>
<p>They stretched in never-ending line</p>
<p>Along the margin of a bay:</p>
<p>Ten thousand saw I at a glance,</p>
<p>Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</p>
