     <p>That perches in the soul -</p>
<p>And sings the tune without the words -</p>
<p>And never stops - at all -</p>

<p>And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -</p>
<p>And sore must be the storm -</p>
<p>That could abash the little Bird</p>
<p>That kept so many warm -</p>

<p>I’ve heard it in the chillest land -</p>
<p>And on the strangest Sea -</p>
<p>Yet - never - in Extremity,</p>
<p>It asked a crumb - of me.</p>
